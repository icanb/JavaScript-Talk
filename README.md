##{better, JavaScript}##

This repo contains the keynote file and sample code for JavaScript talk I've given on 09/09/2012.

Duration: 1.5 hrs

I tried to go through basics of JavaScript instead of fancy stuff.

People are generally unaware of most of the basic rules of JavaScript. My aim was to teach those theorotical points that I find important, such as using the native JS APIs, traversing the DOM tree, being aware of the global namespace and modularizing the part of the code. 

###Simple Bookstore###

I simplified a project that I've worked on before and went through the example step by step. 

In the end, I've also created a version where I put all the code into a bookstore module.


####Other parts####

I'm planning to add details about object oriented JavaScript and the use of prototype in the future and turn this a full-fledge intro to professional JavaScript presentation.
